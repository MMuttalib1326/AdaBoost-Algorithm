# AdaBoost-Algorithm
What is the AdaBoost Algorithm? AdaBoost also called Adaptive Boosting is a technique in Machine Learning used as an Ensemble Method. The most common algorithm used with AdaBoost is decision trees with one level that means with Decision trees with only 1 split. These trees are also called Decision Stumps.
